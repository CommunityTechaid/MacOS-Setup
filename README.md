# CTAMacOS 

This is a script to install the standard suite of Community TechAid programmes on to a Mac.

Core precepts:
- have no prerequisites other than a machine running macOS
- install the latest versions of the programmes
- no / minimal user interaction
- leave machine as it was

Follow up task would be to create a offline version.

Nice to have: also update macOS to latest version.

## Usage

On the Mac that will be recieving the programmes:

```zsh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/techaid-tech/techaid-macOS/main/CTAMacOS.sh > ./CTAMacOS.sh
chmod +x ./CTAMacOS.sh
./CTAMacOS.sh
```
