This is a script to install the standard suite of Community TechAid programmes on to a Mac.

Core precepts:
- have no prerequisites other than a machine running macOS
- install the latest versions of the programmes
- no / minimal user interaction
- leave machine as it was

Follow up task would be to create a offline version.

Nice to have: also update macOS to latest version.
